# PAGE Appstracts: iOS
This is the source code for the PAGE Appstracts app for iOS, originally developed by Maxim Schoemaker. Requires an Apple Mac running recent versions of macOS and Xcode to compile and deploy.

This version is optimized for iOS version 14.3 and should work on Apple mobile devices (iPhones and iPads) up to around 5 years old.
